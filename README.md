# Detailed Remarks

The bulk of your review should be here. Organize your comments according to the evaluation criteria below.

## Novelty

Spend a couple of sentences to explain what is novel about the work. What is the primary contribution?

## Soundness

Your assessment of the soundness of the work should be presented here. Focus on what might threaten the validity of the conclusions that are drawn based upon the results that are observed. For case study research, these are often discussed as threats to validity, such as construct threats (i.e., are the measurements capturing what they intend to measure?), internal threats (i.e., could confounding factors be interfering with the interpretation of the results? Are other plausible hypotheses likely to explain the conclusions?), and external threats (i.e., what might constrain the generalizability of the conclusions beyond the study context?).

## Significance

Your assessment of the significance of the work should be described here. Which stakeholders (e.g., researchers, developers, managers) would be likely to be impacted by the study, and how so?

## Verifiability

To what extent can the work be externally verified and replicated? Provide a short assessment of what has been provided by the authors to aid in replication of their work (e.g., detailed explanantions that would be straightforward to implement, raw data, processed data, data processing scripts, experimental analysis scripts).

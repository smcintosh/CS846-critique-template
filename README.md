# Overview

Provide a summary list of the pros (+) and cons (-) that you elaborate on in the sections below.

# Soundness

Focus on what might threaten the validity of the conclusions that are drawn based upon the results that are observed. For case study research, these are often discussed as threats to validity, such as:

## Threats to Construct Validity

Are the measurements capturing what they intend to measure?

## Threats to Internal Validity

Could confounding factors be interfering with the interpretation of the results? Are other plausible hypotheses likely to explain the conclusions?

## Threats to External Validity

What might constrain the generalizability of the conclusions beyond the study context?

# Significance

What is the breadth and depth of the impact that the contributions may have on research and practice? Which stakeholders (e.g., researchers, developers, managers) would be likely to be impacted by the contributions of the paper, and how so?

# Verifiability

To what extent can the work be externally verified and replicated? Provide a short assessment of what has been provided by the authors to aid in replication of their work (e.g., detailed explanations that would be straightforward to implement, raw data, processed data, data processing scripts, experimental analysis scripts).
